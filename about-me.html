                    <p>
                        I'm Angelica, a graduate student at Virginia Tech, pursuing a Master of Science in Business
                        Administration with a concentration in Business Analytics.

                        I have been a clinical laboratory scientist since 2016, driven by a desire to make a positive
                        impact in the world. I initially pursued this by working in hospitals, but as I
                        advanced—becoming a Laboratory Supervisor and later a Laboratory Director—I realized there was
                        the potential to make an even greater impact. The inefficiencies, poor communication, and lack
                        of analytics in healthcare operations were impossible to ignore. Determined to be part of the
                        solution, I decided to pivot my career and pursue business analytics to help organizations
                        across industries make better, data-driven decisions and solve complex operational challenges.

                        I’m a DIY enthusiast who enjoys dabbling in various hobbies, so I created this website as a
                        place to house my side projects, showcase my interests, and document my journey in analytics and
                        beyond.

                        Thanks for stopping by!
